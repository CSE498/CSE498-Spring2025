# Distribution Class

Description – Create and/or manage various distributions of values that are then used to create graphs with such distributions. Pre-calculating the distributions in order to draw the random faster. 

Similar classes – Random and WeightedSet which carry std::rand, std::set, std::map, std::unordered_map, std::vector, std::accumulate.  

Key functions – Being able to do any distribution we would need for our graphs:  Binomial, power-law, uniform, Poisson, normal, etc. Pre-calculating the distributions will make computation time faster. 

Error conditions – If there is a distribution we do not know. If the distribution is not within a certain range of accuracy. If there are not enough data points for any of the said distributions. 

Expected challenges – Knowing all different distributions that are required (or helpful) for our final website currently. Making sure to catch any errors associated with it. Making sure it runs smoothly and quickly even at large sets and data requirements. 

Other class projects – Random and WeightedSet would help inside this class in order to achieve an outline for different distributions. AnnotatedWrapper would be helpful when implementing the Random and WeightedSet classes from inside my group.
