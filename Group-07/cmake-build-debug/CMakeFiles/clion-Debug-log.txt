CMake Error: The current CMakeCache.txt directory /Users/sidb/Development/CSE498/CSE498-Spring2025/Group-07/cmake-build-debug/_deps/googletest-subbuild/CMakeCache.txt is different than the directory d:/CSE 498 CAPTSTONE/CSE498-Spring2025/Group-07/cmake-build-debug/_deps/googletest-subbuild where CMakeCache.txt was created. This may result in binaries being created in the wrong place. If you are not sure, reedit the CMakeCache.txt
